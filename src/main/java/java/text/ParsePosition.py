# * {@code ParsePosition} is a simple class used by {@code Format}
# * and its subclasses to keep track of the current position during parsing.
# * The {@code parseObject} method in the various {@code Format}
# * classes requires a {@code ParsePosition} object as an argument.
# *
# * <p>
# * By design, as you parse through a string with different formats,
# * you can use the same {@code ParsePosition}, since the index parameter
# * records the current position.
